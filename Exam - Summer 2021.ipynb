    "#### Exam description\n",
    "For this exam, you will predict the target values for the test.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task:\n",
    "find a good machine learning model to predict the target value. Then predict the target values of the instances in the test.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exam rules\n",
    "- You can use only the machine learning models discussed in this course. \n",
    "    - If the prediction is based on a model that is not discussed in class, one of the models in your submission will randomly be selected for grading. \n",
    "- Fifty percent of the grade is based on your Python code submission. The other 50 percent of your grade is based on the evaluation score of the prediction. \n",
    "- The exam should be syntax error-free. Run your code before the final submission. \n",
    "- Save the final prediction array as ``final_test_prediction``. \n",
    "- <font color = 'red'> The final prediction will be evaluated using the **recall** function. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Devliverable\n",
    "Submit ONLY the iPython notebook or the .py file of your work. Use the following frame for your submission. Please don't remove the headers in the following structure. \n",
